# Quantum Simulator with AI Chat and Audio Visualization

A WebGL-based simulation of quantum-inspired particle interactions with integrated AI chat and audio visualization capabilities.

## Features

- Real-time quantum particle simulation with WebGL and Three.js
- Interactive visualization with multiple quantum physics-inspired modes
- Advanced audio visualization that transforms sound into dynamic particle patterns
- Microphone input support for real-time audio visualization
- Harmonic visualization with customizable frequency patterns
- AI chatbot assistant to explain quantum concepts
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Requirements

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- Modern web browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the server
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Usage

- Interact with the visualization by changing the shape and color modes
- Try the "Harmonics" mode to see the audio-reactive particle patterns
- Navigate to the "Audio" tab to use microphone input, load audio files, or generate harmonic tones
- Visualize music and sound as dynamic quantum particle formations
- Click the chat button to interact with the AI assistant
- Ask questions about quantum physics and the current simulation

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Run `bash deploy.sh` to prepare the application
2. Deploy the resulting files to your web server
3. Alternatively, deploy to services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages
